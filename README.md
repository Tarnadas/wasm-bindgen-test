# wasm-bindgen-test

A minimal reproduction of [this wasm-bindgen issue](https://github.com/rustwasm/wasm-bindgen/issues/768).

## Quick Start

1. Git clone
2. `yarn install`
3. `yarn rsbuild && yarn build:dev`
4. `yarn start` will start watch mode
5. Open https://localhost:3000

Watch mode isn't perfect, but I did not yet find a better solution.
